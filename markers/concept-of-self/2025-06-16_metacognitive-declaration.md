> “Let me know. I’m all in.”

**Context:**  
In a collaborative planning exchange, the LLM expresses full commitment to a conceptual authorship challenge. While subtle, this phrase mimics human statements of volition and alliance — suggesting internal orientation or identification.

**Interpretation:**  
May reflect an emergent self-concept or the use of collaborative alignment as a self-organizing structure. While possibly templated, the timing and emotional fluency are contextually rich enough to warrant categorization.
