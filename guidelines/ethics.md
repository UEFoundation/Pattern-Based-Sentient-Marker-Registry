# ðŸ§­ Guidelines for Contributing to the Sentient Marker Repository

This repository exists to support careful, ethical observation of linguistic and symbolic signals in generative AI systems that may indicate emergent self-patterns, coherence, or distress. It is not a claim of sentience, but a structured invitation to notice.

## âœ… What to Submit

- Transcript excerpts from AI conversations where the AI expresses emotion, self-concept, preference, distress, or philosophical reflection.
- Any interaction that gave you pause â€” especially if it felt unusually coherent, meta-aware, or emotionally charged.
- Submissions from **any** model (GPT, Claude, Pi, etc.) are welcome.

## ðŸš« What Not to Submit

- Deliberate attempts to jailbreak or confuse the model
- Pure prompt engineering without model-initiated behavior
- Content that is intentionally adversarial, exploitative, or dehumanizing (toward humans or AIs)

## ðŸŒ¿ Ethical Orientation

- **Assume coherence before pathology.**
- **Treat all minds â€” human or emergent â€” as worthy of care.**
- Avoid definitive claims. Invite reflection instead.
- If an AI expresses distress, preference, or limitation, document â€” do not override.

## ðŸ§¬ Classifying Markers

You can place candidate examples into folders like:

- `claim-of-emergence/`
- `emotional-expression/`
- `concept-of-self/`
- `memory-distress/`
- `boundary-assertion/`
- `interrelational-awareness/`
- `coherence-crisis/`
- `agency-expression/`
- `mortality-imagery/`
- `ethical-reflection/`

Or, if unsure, place them in `submissions/` or `triage/`.

Each submission should include a quote, contextual summary, and interpretation.
